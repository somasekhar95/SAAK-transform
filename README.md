# SAAK-transform
One of the key characteristics of the CNN approach is that features can be learned automatically from the data and their labels through backpropagation. These iteratively optimized features are called the deep or the learned features. Here, we provide a third approach to feature extraction based on multi-stage SAAK transforms. They are the SAAK features. To obtain SAAK features, we need data labels but use them in a different manner. Multi-stage SAAK coefficients of samples from the same class are computed to build feature vectors of that class. We should collect those SAAK coefficients that have higher discriminant power among object classes to reduce the feature dimension.
